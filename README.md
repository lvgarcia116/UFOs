# UFOs
## Overview of Analysis
The purposes of this webpage is to create a dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
When someone accesses the webpage, they can filter the information of UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape or multiple criterias at the same time. The image below shows the data that appears when it is filtered by the data 1/1/2010 and the shape description "light".

## Summary
One draw back of this design is that the Duration column is not consistent. Some of the data within this column just reads "10:00" where as another reads "2-3 seconds". A recommendation for consistency is to apply the same time or duration format for this column. Additionally, since this is a website it should have proper capitalization. Therefore, the city, states, and countries just be capitalized appropriately.
